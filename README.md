# calculator
Calculator is my own project where I have created 4 examples to find solutions for these situations:
1. Calculate the weekly salary with commissions for sales
2. Create a dictionary where the user can ask for some fruits and the program gives the price of this asked item
3. A dice game where the user can roll two dice. The program shows the result of these dice and the sum of both dice.
4. Calculation of calories: This program calculates the maximum amount of chocolate a user can eat daily.
