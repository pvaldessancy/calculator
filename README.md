Calculator Project
Welcome to the Calculator project! This project showcases 4 practical examples designed to provide solutions for various scenarios. Each example demonstrates how Python can be used to address specific tasks efficiently.

Examples:

1. Calculate Weekly Salary with Commissions for Sales
Description: This example calculates the weekly salary of a salesperson, factoring in commissions on sales. The program takes sales and commission rates as input and computes the total earnings.
Purpose: Explore basic mathematical calculations and input processing in Python.

2. Fruit Price Dictionary
Description: In this example, a dictionary is created containing the prices of various fruits. Users can input the name of a fruit, and the program provides the corresponding price.
Purpose: Demonstrate the use of dictionaries for data lookup and user interaction.

3. Dice Game
Description: Engage in a dice game where the user can roll two dice. The program simulates the dice rolls and displays the outcomes of each die along with their sum.
Purpose: Implement random number generation and user interaction to create an interactive game.

4. Calorie Calculator
Description: This program calculates the maximum daily chocolate consumption based on user input for calorie limits. Users can specify their daily calorie limit, and the program computes the chocolate quantity that can be consumed without exceeding this limit.
Purpose: Practice mathematical calculations and conditional statements for practical health-related calculations.
